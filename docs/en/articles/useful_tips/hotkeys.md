### The CV Method
The most prestigious shortcut for programmers to appoint a partner and effectively cut down on duplicate blocks of code against you. However, please be careful not to abuse Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. If there is a part of code that needs to be used repeatedly in a program, a better way is to design it as a function.

### Compile and run (F5/Ctrl+F5)
For different IDEs, the shortcut keys for fast compile and run are different. For example, in VSCode, you just need to press F5 to compile and run your program. If you just want your program to run, then press Ctrl+F5 to skip debugging and run it directly.

### Open a new terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`)
Minimize mouse movements and increase efficiency by using Ctrl+Shift+` to open a new terminal directly in VSCode.

### Switch sidebar on/off (Ctrl+B)
Ctrl+B toggles the sidebar on and off to keep the screen tidy when writing code.

### Enter in line (Ctrl+Enter)
Use Ctrl+Enter to perform a carriage return.

### Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z)
The Undo and Redo shortcuts can be handy to help you perform a rollback state of your code, and are especially useful in some situations.

### Annotate and Undo (Ctrl+/)
Easily batch comment or uncomment lines of code with Ctrl+/. This is a basic shortcut to keep code neat and documentation intact.

### Change indentation (Shift+Tab and Tab)
Use Shift+Tab to decrease the indentation of a selected block of code and Tab to increase the indentation to adjust the indentation of the selected block of code. Good indentation helps to make the code clearer and more readable, and also helps to keep the code formatting consistent. Also Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] can be used to decrease/increase the indentation of a selected block of code, respectively.

### Cut whole lines (Ctrl+X)
Ctrl+X can be used to cut entire lines of code. This feature simplifies code manipulation by eliminating the need to manually select an entire line of code. When there is no block selected by the mouse cursor, it is treated as if it cuts all the code on the line where the cursor is located.

### Move lines of code up and down (Alt+Up and Alt+Down)
Use Alt+Up to move the line of code up and Alt+Down to move the line of code down to quickly reposition the code. This is useful for rearranging import statements, comments or snippets.

### Find and Replace (Ctrl+F and Ctrl+H)
If the user needs to find a specific code snippet in a pile of code, just press Ctrl+F. But what many people overlook is Ctrl+H , which allows users to replace all occurrences of a word or phrase.

### Zoom UI (Ctrl++/-)

### Select all matches
Ctrl+Shift+l selects all matches, making it easier to change an amount globally.

### Cursor switching (Ctrl+Up/Down/Left/Right)
Find letter-based cursor jumping too much of a hassle? Just hold down the Ctrl key and your cursor will automatically jump in blocks of code.

### Multi-word operations (Ctrl+D and Ctrl+U)
Ctrl+D lets the user select the next word at the cursor's location, making it especially convenient to use it to make multiple changes in your code. Conversely, Ctrl+U deselects the last word selected, making it useful for deselecting specific words.

### Multi-cursor operations (Alt+left mouse button)
Alt+Left Mouse Button makes it easy to add a cursor to the left mouse button's selection, allowing multiple cursors to be operated at the same time.
