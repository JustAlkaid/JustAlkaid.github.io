This page is a collection of links to some question sites.

## Luogu
Link: https://www.luogu.com.cn/

A very popular question list site for OIers. You may not quite get used to the OI atmosphere of the site at once, but many of the questions are still worth doing.

You can download a few data points per day, and basically consider the data points to be unreadable.

You can also find quite a few board (template) questions on there.

## Leetcode
Link: https://leetcode.cn/

The stuff is very diverse, supports a variety of programming languages (even including things like MySQL, which is not considered a programming language), the data points are all publicly available, and there is basically no limit on time or memory usage. The problem solving is also very detailed, and it's great for people who want to learn or practice in a relaxed environment. There are also weekly competitions.

The questions are simpler than Logu, and there are some question lists organized by knowledge points or question types to brush up on.

Leetcode's questions are different from other sites in that they don't require the person doing the question to upload the complete code, but only the part that implements the core logic. Therefore, the submission box is usually the framework of a function, and the required data is passed in the form of function parameters. Sometimes to prevent memory leaks, the questioner is also asked to open an array using malloc() so that the Leetcode evaluator can call free() to free the memory.

There are interview questions from various big companies. If you plan to get a job in the future, you can check here.
