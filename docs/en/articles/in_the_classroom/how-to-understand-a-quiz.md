## How to review questions

## 1. Look at the time limit and memory limit of the question.
These two limits indirectly determine the kind of algorithms you can use (e.g., if the memory limit is small, you may not be able to open a million arrays, and a time limit of 2000ms means you can do less optimization), and it may be that whether you can do a problem or not is determined by these two factors! Don't realize you can MLE/TLE halfway through a problem!

## 2. Don't waste time on nonsense!
In most cases, all the words in the question are useful, but sometimes the question will introduce some useless background (e.g., Ayo eating a candy cane). If you are sure that a paragraph is nonsense that is not useful for doing the question, skip reading or boldly skip it. This saves time and helps you see the true difficulty of the question.

## 3. Look at and memorize variable names (what variable does each letter represent? What does the subscript mean?)
You may not need to pay attention to this in the first 5 questions, but when there are more variables and you don't pay attention to the variable names, you may get confused by the format of the input data and be forced to reread the questions, which interrupts your train of thought and results in a waste of time. Never read the question in order to pursue the speed of reading the question in the title of the variable to do the explanation of the place to spend less time, sharpening the knife is not a waste of time.

## 4. Look at the range of data values.
> Ten years of OI is empty, not sue long long makes you fail completely.

On the one hand, you have to decide whether you want to use int or long long based on the order of magnitude; on the other hand, whether a variable can take a particular value (e.g., 0 is a divisor, 1 is not a prime number) will determine whether or not you want to add a special judgment condition in your program. If you don't pay attention to this point and miss the WA, you will easily get a preconceived idea of what you want to do when you revisit the problem at a later stage, and you won't be able to find out what you're doing wrong!

## 5. Look at the hint
As we all know, hints are written by the person who wrote the question, so the contents of the hints are likely to match the optimal/easiest solution to the question. In addition, the hints may even remind you which page of the ppt you can refer to, so it's a great time to copy the code.

## 6. Pay attention to the value ranges of different data points.
Most of the formal questions will include the range of different data points at the end of the question (e.g. for the first 20% of the data, ......; for the first 50% of the data, ......). This is actually a means of differentiating between players, ensuring that average players get a fraction of the points, while differentiating between higher level players.  
If you run out of time or just don't know how to do it, you might as well use the simplest violent algorithm to get a portion of the score and walk away. AC is good, but ultimately it's about assigning points according to rankings, so it's worth it even if you're only right about one test point.

## 7. Utilize sample inputs & outputs
Some of the questions are described in a very complex way in order to be rigorous and concise. So if you can't understand a question, you may want to re-examine the question with sample inputs & outputs, and then you may understand it.
