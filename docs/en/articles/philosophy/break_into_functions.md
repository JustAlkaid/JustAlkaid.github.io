# Encapsulate functions into functions
In programming, encapsulation is one of the key means to improve code readability, maintainability and reusability. Encapsulating functions into functions is a common and effective practice of encapsulation. In the process of writing code, the use of functions can effectively solve the overall structure of a piece of code reuse too much lead to bloat, while a reasonable function design can also improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

## How to encapsulate functions?
Encapsulating a function into a function simply means extracting a block of code with independent functions and defining it as a function. In this way, the entire program does not repeat the code, but rather calls the function to achieve the corresponding function. The encapsulation of the function needs to be defined outside the main function, note that only one main function can appear in a project.

## Advantages of encapsulating functions
### Improve code reusability
Wrapping a function allows us to call it from other parts of the program without having to spend time writing it each time. This makes the program more concise. For example, if you encapsulate a fast power as a function, you can call it when you need to use the fast power without having to write code to read the file every time. Also, you can save some of the highly used functions on your own device, which can save you a very large amount of time. This site provides a list of some common functions that can be copied.
### Enhancing Code Maintainability
If there is a change in the implementation of a function, we only need to change the code inside the function, not every place in the program where the function is called. This avoids the propagation of errors caused by modifying a function and improves the maintainability of the code.
### Simplify the debugging process
Splitting complex code into smaller functions not only improves the readability of the program, but also makes debugging easier. When debugging, we can more easily locate the function that is in error instead of searching for the problem in a huge piece of code.
### Improving code readability
Small, clear functions usually need to have good naming and a single responsibility, making the intent of the code clearer. This makes the purpose of the different code blocks of your program clear at a glance.

## Notes on encapsulated functions
### Good naming
The name of a function should clearly reflect what it does so that other developers can understand what it does by the function name. Avoid vague or overly short names such as “func1” or “doSomething” and instead use something like “calculate_Total_Price “ or “validate_User_Input”. There are several common naming conventions that you can refer to when naming.
### Avoid overly long functions
Even for a seemingly simple function, excessively long code can lead to poor readability. It's best to keep each function to no more than 20-30 lines of code, and if that's too much, consider splitting it into smaller functions. This avoids code bloat and enhances maintainability.
### Use parameters and return values wisely
The inputs and outputs of a function should be clear and unambiguous. Make sure that the parameters of a function are few and have a clear purpose, and avoid passing too many parameters. The return value of a function should also be as simple as possible, avoiding complex results that are hard to understand.

## Conclusion
###### Encapsulating functions into functions is a fundamental and important skill in programming. It not only improves code reusability, maintainability, and readability, but also makes the structure of the program clearer. By following good naming conventions, the principle of single responsibility and reasonable parameter design, we can write more concise and easy-to-understand code. Therefore, whether you are facing a small project or a complex application, encapsulating functions is an indispensable good habit.
